"""Extract entities from text using a regex.

This model is a baseline that uses the a regex to extract entities from the
text. This model will extract entitites that are not datasets, but the goal
is high recall. This model could be combined with an entity classifier to
increast the precision of the model.

Example:

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import democratizing_data_ml_algorithms.models.regex_model as rm
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({"text": ["This is a sentence with an entity in it."]})
    >>> config = {"regex_pattern": r"entity"}
    >>> df = rm.inference(config, df)

class RegexModel(bm.Model):
    """Extract entities from text using a regex.

    This class will extract entities from text using a regex pattern. The
    regex pattern can be configured using the "regex_pattern" key in the
    configuration dictionary. The default regex pattern is defined above
    as ENTITY_PATTERN. The regex pattern is compiled using the regex library
    and the compiled pattern is stored in the `entity_pattern` attribute.

    Optionally, the regex pattern can be configured using the "keywords" key
    in the configuration dictionary. The "keywords" key should be a list of
    strings. Each string in the list will be converted to a regex pattern
    that will be used to extract entities from the text. The regex pattern
    for each keyword is defined as follows:

    -   If the keyword is a single word and it is all caps, then the keyword
        will not be converted to a regex pattern, it will be treated as an
        acronym.
    -   If the keyword is a single word and it is not all caps, then the
        keyword will be converted to a regex pattern that matches the keyword,
        ignoring the case for the keyword.
    -   If the keyword is multiple words, then the keyword will be converted
        to a regex pattern that matches the keyword, ignoring the case for
        the first letter of each word in the keyword.

    Example:
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> import democratizing_data_ml_algorithms.models.regex_model as rm
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame({"text": ["This is a sentence with an entity in it."]})
