In addition , a supplemental analysis reports on the impact of different amounts of dual enrollment course - taking and college degree attainment . Dual enrollment programs offer college - level learning experiences for high school students . The programs offer college courses and/or the opportunity to earn college credits for students while still in high school . The intervention group in the study was comprised of NELS participants who attended a postsecondary school and who participated in a dual enrollment program while in high school ( n = 880 ) . The study author used propensity score matching methods to create a comparison group of NELS participants who also attended a postsecondary school but who did not participate in a dual enrollment program in high school ( n = 7,920 ) . Dual enrollment programs allow high school students to take college courses and earn college credits while still in high school . These programs are intended to improve college attainment , especially among low - income students , by helping students prepare academically for the rigors of college coursework and enabling students to accumulate college credits toward a degree . The study reported program impacts on two outcomes : attainment of any college degree and attainment of a Bachelor 's degree . These impacts were examined for various subgroups of students , which are described below . What did the study find ? The study reported , and the WWC confirmed , that dual enrollment programs significantly increased the likelihood of attaining ( a ) any college degree and ( b ) a bachelor 's degree . The study reported on the impact of dual enrollment programs for first generation college students , students whose parents had some college , students whose parents had a Bachelor 's degree , and students with post - Bachelor 's degree parents . Although point estimates differed for the subgroups of students with different parental educational backgrounds , the subgroups were not significantly different from each other . The overall impact of dual enrollment programs is , therefore , the WWC 's best estimate of effectiveness for these subgroups ( see Appendix D for more information ) . The study author also examined whether students who earned more dual enrollment credits prior to attending college achieved greater benefits from the dual enrollment programs . The impact of dual enrollment was significantly different for students earning three dual enrollment credits versus those earning six or more credits . Students who earned three credits ( i.e. , had one dual enrollment course ) were not more likely to attain a college degree than comparison group students . However , students who earned six credits ( i.e. , two courses ) and students who earned seven or more credits were significantly more likely to attain any college degree or a bachelor 's degree than comparison students ( see Appendix D for more information ) . A sample of these respondents was then resurveyed through four follow - ups in 1990 , 1992 , 1994 , and 2000 . The fourth follow - up ( 2000 ) was used for this study . Appendix B : Outcome measures for the degree attainment domain   Study Notes : A correction for multiple comparisons was needed but did not affect significance levels . The p - values presented here were reported in the original study . The mean differences reported in the table are covariate - adjusted mean differences and were taken from The research described in this report meets WWC evidence standards with reservations Cautions : Although the study matched students who participated in dual enrollment programs to those who did not , students who self - selected to participate in dual enrollment programs may have been different from students in general high school programs in ways that were unobserved in the study data . Study sample A nationally representative sample of eighth graders was first surveyed in the spring of 1988 . The intervention group was comprised of those individuals in the NELS sample who attended college and participated in dual enrollment programs in high school . No other information about the nature or characteristics of the dual enrollment programs was provided . The comparison group was comprised of NELS participants who attended college but did not participate in a dual enrollment program in high school . The comparison students participated in other high school programs ( e.g. , traditional high school programs or Advanced Placement programs ) . There were two outcomes examined in the study : any college degree attainment and bachelor 's degree attainment . Both outcomes were derived from the fourth follow - up of the NELS collected in 2000 . For a more detailed description of these outcome measures , see Appendix B. The study was based on secondary data from a nationally representative survey of students . No information about the nature of the training for dual enrollment providers or implemenation was provided . This study was identified for review by receiving media attention .

       " collected in 2000 . Only students who attended college were included in the study . The effect size is a standardized measure of the effect of an intervention on student outcomes , representing the change ( measured in standard deviations ) in an average student 's outcome that can be expected if the student is given the intervention . The improvement index is an alternate presentation of the effect size , reflecting the change in an average student 's percentile rank that can be expected if the student is given the intervention . The WWC - computed average effect size is a simple average rounded to two decimal places ; the average improvement index is calculated from the average effect size . The statistical significance of the study 's domain average was determined by the WWC ; the study is characterized as having a statistically significant positive effect because univariate statistical tests are reported for each outcome measure and both effects are positive and statistically significant , accounting for multiple comparisons . nr = not reported . A correction for multiple comparisons was needed , but did not affect the statistical significance of the outcomes . The p - values presented here were reported in the original study . Effect sizes were computed using the covariate - adjusted mean difference and standard errors reported in Table 1 of the manuscript . This quasi - experimental study used propensity score matching to create a comparison group ; therefore , the WWC required that baseline equivalence be established to determine whether the study met standards with reservations . Because the two outcomes reported above did not have pretests , two key covariates were selected by the WWC from among those used by the study author in the propensity score matching : family income and prior achievement . In response to a request by the WWC , the author provided baseline means and standard deviations for the analytic sample on these two covariates . The baseline effect sizes for family income and prior achievement were 0.02 and 0.00 , respectively . The study therefore meets WWC standards with reservations because baseline equivalence was met on these two covariates . Table Notes : Positive results for mean difference , effect size , and improvement index favor the intervention group ; negative results favor the comparison group . The effect size is a standardized measure of the effect of an intervention on student outcomes , representing the change ( measured in standard deviations ) in an average student 's outcome that can be expected if the student is given the intervention . The improvement index is an alternate presentation of the effect size , reflecting the change in an average student 's percentile rank that can be expected if the student is given the intervention . nr = not reported . Attrition Attrition occurs when an outcome variable is not available for all participants initially assigned to the intervention and comparison groups . The WWC considers the total attrition rate and the difference in attrition rates across groups within a study . Clustering adjustment If intervention assignment is made at a cluster level and the analysis is conducted at the student level , the WWC will adjust the statistical significance to account for this mismatch , if necessary . Confounding factor A confounding factor is a component of a study that is completely aligned with one of the study conditions , making it impossible to separate how much of the observed effect was due to the intervention and how much was due to the factor . Design The design of a study is the method by which intervention and comparison groups were assigned . Domain A domain is a group of closely related outcomes . Effect size The effect size is a measure of the magnitude of an effect . The WWC uses a standardized measure to facilitate comparisons across studies and outcomes . Eligibility A study is eligible for review if it falls within the scope of the review protocol and uses either an experimental or matched comparison group design . Equivalence A demonstration that the analysis sample groups are similar on observed characteristics defined in the review area protocol . Improvement index Along a percentile distribution of students , the improvement index represents the gain or loss of the average student due to the intervention . As the average student starts at the 50th percentile , the measure ranges from -50 to +50 . When a study includes multiple outcomes or comparison groups , the WWC will adjust the statistical significance to account for the multiple comparisons , if necessary . A quasi - experimental design ( QED ) is a research design in which subjects are assigned to intervention and comparison groups through a process that is not random . A randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) is an experiment in which investigators randomly assign eligible participants into intervention and comparison groups . A research approach in which an outcome variable is measured repeatedly within and across different conditions that are defined by the presence or absence of an intervention . The standard deviation of a measure shows how much variation exists across observations in the sample . A low standard deviation indicates that the observations in the sample tend to be very close to the mean ; a high standard deviation indicates that the observations in the sample are spread out over a large range of values . Statistical significance Statistical significance is the probability that the difference between groups is a result of chance rather than a real difference between the groups . The WWC labels a finding statistically significant if the likelihood that the difference is due to chance is less than 5 % ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Substantively important A substantively important finding is one that has an effect size of 0.25 or greater , regardless of statistical significance .
